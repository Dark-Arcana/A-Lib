# AlchemyLib 1.19.2-1.0.20 RELEASE

Been a while since there was an update. I've been busy! But the most reported issue is with input/output for processing machines in Alchemistry, so here we go.

Changes:
- Add simple directionality to InventoryBlockEntity abstract classes such that they return input or output depending on the direction. This should make people happy.
- Update Forge.
